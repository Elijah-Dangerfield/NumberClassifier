# NumberClassifier

This is an Android application built built based off of the tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWKdLOxykE&t=111s

I created a classifier with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using keras and jupyter notebook and exported the model as a .tflite file to bring into an Android Studio project. Code found here:[Classifier](https://github.com/Elijah-Dangerfield/Classifier)

# Run Code
To run this application, simply clone the project, open inside of the Android Studio environment, and run on either on a simulator or on an Android Device. Draw a digit on the screen and then press the "detect" button to get the detected digit.
